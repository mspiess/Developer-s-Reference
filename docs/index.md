# Developer's Reference

During my work as a Software Developer I try to support any claims made with appropriate sources.
Referencing books is fine, but one cannot assume that others own said books or will obtain them.
This site is my attempt of providing an accessible resource of the various things I'd reference.

Since this is especially useful for Code Reviews some articles provide a template markdown comments.
See the following example:

<div>
    <markdown-review-comment-generator
        inputs="yourName, myName"
        generate="`Hi ${yourName},
I'm trying out the [Developer's Reference](TODO).
Seems *promising* so far.
Let me know what **you** think!
Best regards,
${myName}`"
    />
</div>
