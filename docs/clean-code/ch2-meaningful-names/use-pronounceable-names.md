# Use Pronounceable Names

At times you want to be able to talk about the code with your colleagues.
Pronounceable names let you do this, without sounding ridiculous.
For instance, take the variable name `saveUsrAdmBtn`.
Do you pronounce it "Save U-S-R-A-D-M-B-T-N", "Save Usre Admhh Bhttn" or something in between?
Either way may sound funny, but new colleagues would have to have variable names explained to them.
Whereas the name `saveUserAdministratorButton` needs no explanations and allows reasonable communication.

> The Save-User-Administrator-Button is not rendered, unless there are changes made. Is that intended?
